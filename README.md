# 1. What is Angular Framework?

Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end platform that makes it easy to build applications with in web/mobile/desktop. The major features of this framework such as declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and many more other features are used to ease the development.

2. ### What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?
    Angular is a completely revived component-based framework in which an application is a tree of individual components.

    Some of the major difference in tabular form

    | AngularJS | Angular |
    |---- | ---------
    | It is based on MVC architecture  | This is based on Service/Controller |
    | This uses use JavaScript to build the application| Introduced the typescript to write the application |
    | Based on controllers concept| This is a component based UI approach|
    | Not a mobile friendly framework| Developed considering mobile platform|
    | Difficulty in SEO friendly application development| Ease to create SEO friendly applications|

3. ### What is TypeScript?
    TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language.
    You can install it globally as
    ```
    npm install -g typescript
    ```
    Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,
    ```typescript
    function greeter(person: string) {
        return "Hello, " + person;
    }

    let user = "Vandna";

    document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);
    ```
    The greeter method allows only string type as argument.

  4. ### What are the key components of Angular 2?
  
   Angular 2 has the following components −

   **Modules** − This is used to break up the application into logical pieces of code. Each piece of code or module is designed to perform a single task.

   **Component** − This can be used to bring the modules together.

   **Templates** − This is used to define the views of an Angular JS application.

   **Metadata** − This can be used to add more data to an Angular JS class.

   **Service** − This is used to create components which can be shared across the entire application.

6. ### What are components?
    Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app which formed a tree of Angular components. These components are subset of directives. Unlike directives, components always have a template and only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template.
    Let's see a simple example of Angular component
    ```typescript
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    @Component ({
       selector: 'my-app',
       template: ` <div>
          <h1>{{title}}</h1>
          <div>Learn Angular6 with examples</div>
       </div> `,
    })

    export class AppComponent {
       title: string = 'Welcome to Angular world';
    }
    ```

  7. ### What are directives?
    Directives add behaviour to an existing DOM element or an existing component instance.
    ```typescript
    import { Directive, ElementRef, Input } from '@angular/core';

    @Directive({ selector: '[myHighlight]' })
    export class HighlightDirective {
        constructor(el: ElementRef) {
           el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
        }
    }
    ```

    Now this directive extends HTML element behavior with a yellow background as below
    ```html
    <p myHighlight>Highlight me!</p>
    ```

8. ### What are the differences between Component and Directive?
    In a short note, A component(@component) is a directive-with-a-template.

    Some of the major differences are mentioned in a tabular form

    | Component | Directive |
    |---- | ---------
    | To register a component we use @Component meta-data annotation  | To register directives we use @Directive meta-data annotation |
    | Components are typically used to create UI widgets| Directive is used to add behavior to an existing DOM element |
    | Component is used to break up the application into smaller components| Directive is use to design re-usable components|
    | Only one component can be present per DOM element | Many directives can be used per DOM element |
    | @View decorator or templateurl/template are mandatory | Directive doesn't use View|

9. ### What is a template?
    A template is a HTML view where you can display data by binding controls to properties of an Angular component. You can store your component's template in one of two places. You can define it inline using the template property, or you can define the template in a separate HTML file and link to it in the component metadata using the @Component decorator's templateUrl property.
    **Using inline template with template syntax,**
    ```typescript
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    @Component ({
       selector: 'my-app',
       template: '
          <div>
             <h1>{{title}}</h1>
             <div>Learn Angular</div>
          </div>
       '
    })

    export class AppComponent {
       title: string = 'Hello World';
    }
    ```
    **Using separate template file such as app.component.html**
    ```typescript
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    @Component ({
       selector: 'my-app',
       templateUrl: 'app/app.component.html'
    })

    export class AppComponent {
       title: string = 'Hello World';
    }
    ```

10. ### What is a module?

    Modules are logical boundaries in your application and the application is divided into separate modules to separate the functionality of your application.
    Lets take an example of **app.module.ts** root module declared with **@NgModule** decorator as below,
    ```typescript
    import { NgModule }      from '@angular/core';
    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { AppComponent }  from './app.component';

    @NgModule ({
       imports:      [ BrowserModule ],
       declarations: [ AppComponent ],
       bootstrap:    [ AppComponent ]
    })
    export class AppModule { }
    ```
    The NgModule decorator has three options
    1. The imports option is used to import other dependent modules. The BrowserModule is required by default for any web based angular application
    2. The declarations option is used to define components in the respective module
    3. The bootstrap option tells Angular which Component to bootstrap in the application
