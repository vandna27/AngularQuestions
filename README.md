3. ### What is TypeScript?
    TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language.
    You can install it globally as
    ```
    npm install -g typescript
    ```
    Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,
    ```typescript
    function greeter(person: string) {
        return "Hello, " + person;
    }

    let user = "Vandna";

    document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);
    ```
    The greeter method allows only string type as argument.
